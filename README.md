# Elder-Health-Monitoring-System
Embedded Systems Project - A health monitoring system for elders who are bed-ridden and requires continuous monitoring

# Abstract
The Arduino Health Monitoring System offers a comprehensive solution for continuous health tracking of elderly and critical patients. Utilizing Arduino boards and various sensors, including heart rate, temperature, oxygen saturation, and motion sensors, the system provides real-time data accessible through a web application. It serves as an early warning system, detecting abnormalities and ensuring prompt intervention.The user-friendly web interface allows remote access, enabling caregivers and medical professionals to monitor vital signs and receive alerts,enhancing overall patient care

# Components Required
1. Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino Uno or Arduino Nano)
2. Sensors:
   - Heart rate sensor (e.g., Pulse sensor)
   - Temperature and humidity sensor (e.g., DHT11 or DHT22)
   - Oxygen saturation (SpO2) sensor (e.g., MAX30100)
   - Motion sensor (e.g., PIR motion sensor)
3. Communication Interface:
   - Wi-Fi module (e.g., ESP8266) for internet connectivity
4. Power Source:
   - Rechargeable battery pack or USB power source
